    <p>
        Once upon a time, {{person}} ruled all the land...but only conquered
        where the light touches. {{person}} valiantly rode on a noble, {{color}}
        horse named {{person}}ation, which feasted upon {{noun}}s all day long.<br>
        {{person}} set off on a long journey to conquer the shadowlands but they
        were way too {{adjective}}, so {{person}} and {{person}}ation went home
        and learned Python. 
    <br>And that is how Abraham Lincoln became the 14th president.<br>
